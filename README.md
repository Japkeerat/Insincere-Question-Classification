NOTE: To run these notebook, use Sagemaker or if you have 16+ GB of RAM and GPU on your device, then go for it offline.

This notebook explains my approach to the Quora's competition on Kaggle where one had to classify whether questions are sincere or insincere depending upon a number of parameters. More details can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification

In this notebook, I have used GloVe embedding. Download it from here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ or if you are downloading dataset, it is provided with it.
